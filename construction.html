    <p>The Bb (flat) trumpet is made from tubes of brass wrapped in oblong shapes. Sound is made by blowing air through the
lips and make a buzzing sound at the same time. The air travels all thorughout the trumpet and comes out the bell of
the instrument, acting like an amplifier. When the valves are pressed, the air is rerouted into slides of varying length.
This changes the distance the air has to travel, thus affecting the pitch that is produced. This effect can be seen in
the diagram below.</p>

    <p>Tuning can also be done by either pulling out or pushing in the tuning slide to make the pitch lower or higher
respectively.</p>

    <p>Trumpets that are pitched in a different key will have different amounts of tubing so that the harmonics of the
instruments are different than that of a Bb trumpet. Because of this, some trumpets have a fourth valve which is used
to lower the pitch of the instrument a half step. This is useful for expanding the range of the instrument so that
it can play more notes.</p>

    <p>When assembling a trumpet, there are only 2 pieces that are necessary. Those parts are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mouthpiece</li>
      <li>Horn itself</li>
    </ul>
