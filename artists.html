    <h3 class="artistname">Louis Armstrong</h3>
    <p>
      Amrstrong served as one of the ambassadors of jazz. His career spanned five decades, as well as numerous genres of jazz.
      Not only was Armstrong a renouned jazz trumpeter, but his unique voice became instantly recognizable, opening him up to
      the world of jazz vocals. From playing in bands like the Red Onion Jazz Babies, to the famous Louis Armstrong and his hot five,
      Armstrong would go on to lead one of the most successful solo jazz careers in history.
    </p>
    <h3 class="artistname">Miles Davis</h3>
    <p>
      Davis was born in Illinois, which is where he developed his love of music. He was accepted into Juliard to study music, but
      would ultimately leave the schoolot make his professional debut in saxophonist Charlie Parker's bebop quintet. It is here that
      Davis' style came to be known. While recording music for Capitol Records, it became known that Davis was suffering from
      substance abuse. In the mid 1950's Miles signed with Colombia Records and created an album alongside saxophonist John Coltrane
      and basist Paul Chambers.

    <h3 class="artistname">Arturo Sandoval</h3>
    <p>
      Arturo Sandoval became interested in the trumpet at the age of 12, taking classical lessons,
      later enrolling in the Cuban School of National Arts at just 15 where he studied with a russian
      classical trumpeter. In the late 1970's Sandoval started a band that would become the famous
      Afro-Cuban band Irekere. Later in the 70's snadoval met his idol, Dizzy Gillespie, and began
      to create music with him. After releasing many albums and touring Europe, Sandoval left his
      band and began to work on his solo work and to record music in Cuba.
    </p>
    <h3 class="artistname">Wynton Marsalis</h3>
    <p>
      Wynton Marsalis was only 6 years old when he started to play the trumpet. This was a result of
      him growing up in a musical family. Marsalis grew uo in New orleans where his father was a musician
      himself, as well as a teacher. Wynton's brother was also a jazz muisician. This jumpstart on
      playing the trumpet proved to be quite advantageous, with Marsalis playing at his local church
      at 8 years old and in the New Orleans Philharmonic at just 14. Wynton went on to win a grammy for
      classical recordings. Marsalis' strong background in music opened the opportunity for him to
      create a jazz program at Lincoln Center. Now, Marsalis is the director of Jazz at Lincoln
      Canter.
